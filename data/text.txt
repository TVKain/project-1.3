The operations of insertion and deletion cause the dynamic set
represented by a binary search tree to change. The data structure must
be modified to reflect this change, but in such a way that the 
binary-search-tree property continues to hold. We will see that modifying the tree
to insert a new element is relatively straightforward, but deleting a node
from a binary search tree is more complicated.
